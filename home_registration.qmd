Participants from the public sector, companies and other relevant stakeholders are warmly welcome as well. In order for you and other participants to benefit the most, you should *consider yourself eligible* if you are comfortable with:

- Reading and transforming data, 
- Installing and using third-party packages and 
- Plotting using standard R graphics.

## Selection

We can accomodate ~42 participants. Selection criteria include correct entry requirements, motivation to attend the workshop as well as gender and geographical balance. We do accept international applicants, but applicants affiliated to a Swedish institution are prioritized.

Once the registration period concludes, we will review your application and notify you of our decision. If and when accepted, you will have [five working days]{.badge} to notify us if you cannot participate and want to decline the acceptance. Failure to do so would imply your inability to attend, and we will proceed accordingly. Once you confirmed, our course administrator will proceed with invoicing.

## Fee

The fee for academic participants is [9500 SEK]{.badge .badge-primary} subsidized by academic grants. Fee for non-academic participants is **19000 SEK**.

::: {.callout-warning}
If you register and are admitted but fail to attend without a valid reason (sickness or urgent family matter), you will still be liable for the entire fee.

## Venue

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
#| output: asis

dfr <- dfr %>%
  mutate(address = paste0("<a target='_blank' href='", url, "'>", label, "</a>,", address)) %>%
  mutate(address = gsub(",", "<br>", address))

The workshop is held on [Campus Gotland](http://www.campusgotland.uu.se/), Uppsala University. Here is the full address:

::: {.large}

[B27 Lärosal](https://link.mazemap.com/q9F307rf)  
Campus Gotland  
Uppsala University  
Cramérgatan 3  
621 57 Visby  
Gotland, Sweden  

:::

::: {.callout-note}
The classroom windows may be left open in case the room gets warm. If you are easily disturbed by external noise, it might a good idea to bring noise cancelling headphones for practical labs (we are close to Visby harbor). If it's a wet summer, it might be cold in the classroom, so it's good to carry couple of pieces of warm clothing.
