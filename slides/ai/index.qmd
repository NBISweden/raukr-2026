Rstudio
  1. setup copilot
  2. Where you can see it searching for code completions
  3. High level goal start of file

## Rough draft of topics

IDEA: Very few slides, mostly live coding with a script of things to show.

  
Setting up github copilot in R (demo)
https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/ide/guide/tools/copilot.html

Using Rstudio and copilot (demo)
  - how it works in Rstudio
  - Best to split big problems into smaller pieces
    - write a high-level goal at the start of the file
    - View(penguins)
    - Write code, whole function
    - write code, just a line
    - Write comments
    - Write questions
    - Find bugs


querying llms in R using ellmer (demo)

Other IDE's
  - Visual Studio Code (demo)
  - positron
  
No labs on this topic for several reasons: (slide)
  - not applicable to everyone
  - Quick moving field where things are changing often
  - This should be more of a inspirational lecture.

If I have time: (slide)
How to write good prompts
